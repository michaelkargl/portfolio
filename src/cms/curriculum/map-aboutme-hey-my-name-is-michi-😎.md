  ## Professional


  A Full-Stack Engineer passionate about IoT,  Cross Platform development, system automation, architecture and code quality. My main stacks are .NET / Angular & React / Azure


  ## Personal


  I enjoy cycling in my free time and maintain a 15-year-old Minecraft family server where I like to experiment with electrical circuitry. In  recent years I’ve been dabbling in embedded development but also become passionate about progressive web apps (PWAs) and developing offline tools for personal use with React and Lit. I have a keen interest in anything related to PowerShell and F#. Non-nerdy hobbies include pen-paling and practicing CrossFit 🏋️
