## ‚å®Ô∏è Quick start

1. Clone the repository
1. ```shell
   # install dependencies
   yarn
   # Run local dev server
   # This starts both CMS and local server and can take a second
   yarn run start
   ```

1. Open your browser and visit <http://localhost:8000>
1. To access the CMS admin panel, visit <http://localhost:8000/admin>

> If the URLs wont work, please check configuration for the right port or the URL printed in the console after serving
> it locally.

## CMS

The project uses a CMS to form its content. To be able to write files to the local git repository
it needs an API to connect to. This api is started automatically with

```shell
yarn run start
```

together with the development server.

> Note: With the local setup, there isn't any login necessary but sometimes
> something goes wrong and you land on a login page. Sometimes a simple page reload
> work, othertimes you might have to re-run. Safest way is to run the cms separately.

## Deploy

Deployment is setup to happen on every push to `gh-pages`. Try out if the application
looks good by serving your public folder first.

```
npm run serve
```
