## ‚å®Ô∏è Quick start

1. Clone the repository
1. ```pwsh
   # install dependencies
   yarn
   # run local dev server
   yarn run start

   # if you want to access the CMS
   yarn run serve:cms
   ```

1. Open your browser and visit <http://localhost:8000>
1. To access the CMS admin panel, visit <http://localhost:8000/admin>

> If the URLs wont work, please check configuration for the right port or the URL printed in the console after serving
> it locally.

## CMS

The project uses a CMS to form its content. To be able to write files to the local git repository
it needs an API to connect to. This api can be started by doing 

```pwsh
yarn run serve:cms
```

> Note: Sometimes the auto login doesn't work. In which case do a page refresh.
> It should automatically open the CMS admin panel.

## Deploy

At the moment, deployment is done manually to the `gh-pages` branch:

```pwsh
yarn run deploy
```
